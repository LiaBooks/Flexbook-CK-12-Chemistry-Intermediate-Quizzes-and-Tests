30. Given the structures for adenine and uracil, what would a base pair look like if these two compounds formed H-bonds? Assume that adenine connects with the rest of the chain at the N in the five-membered ring that does not have a double bond. Uracil will connect to the rest of the chain at the N at the bottom of the structure (not the one between the two C=O groups).
